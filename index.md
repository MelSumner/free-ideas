# Ideas

These are ideas for things I wished existed that I may or may not get around to creating some day.  Feel free to create any of them! 

- accessible typeform
- version control for laws
- app that tracks human rights over time to show how things evolve (or don't)
- standard perf tests vs tracerbench
