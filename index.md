# Ideas

These are ideas for things I wished existed that I may or may not get around to creating some day.  Feel free to create any of them! 

- accessible typeform
- version control for laws
- app that tracks human rights over time to show how things evolve (or don't)
- standard perf tests vs tracerbench
- something that finally fixes how hard date management in apps are
- an app that would allow you to test a keyboard shortcut combination and then tell you if it was already used by a screen reader or was a common OS keyboard shortcut (or if you genuinely found one that you can use)
- an app that would let you track your "wins" over time. You can define what your wins are! Our minds remember the bad stuff more easily than the good stuff, so let's make the good stuff tracked and easier to remember.
